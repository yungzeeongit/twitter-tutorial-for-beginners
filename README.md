# Welcome To Twitter: A Comprehensive Guide To Navigating The Twitterverse

## Introduction

Twitter, now known as X, is a free social networking site. Established in 2006 by co-founders Jack Dorsey and Evan Williams, it was originally conceived as an SMS-based communication platform. Since its inception, Twitter has grown immensely, allowing users to chat, connect with friends and colleagues, access the latest news, engage in diverse opinions on trending issues, host Twitter Spaces, build communities, and connect with like-minded people.

Under the ownership of Elon Musk since 2022, Twitter has expanded its features and user base, making it popular among many. However, for new users, navigating the Twitterverse can be confusing. This guide is designed to help you explore and understand this platform. Let's embark on this journey through the world of X.

Tweets are the core of Twitter, consisting of 280-character messages (as of my last knowledge update in September 2021). These tweets can include text, images, links, and more. You can engage with tweets by liking, retweeting, or replying to them.

On the right side of your homepage, you'll find "Trending Topics." These are popular hashtags and discussions happening on Twitter at that moment.
